# Repository Guidance

- Use the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) for builds and tests.
- Keep documentation and code comments concise and in English.
- When modifying Android resources, prefer AndroidX components and follow existing naming conventions.
- Run relevant Gradle tasks (e.g., `./gradlew test` or module-specific checks) before submitting changes when time permits.
